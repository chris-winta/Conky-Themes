# Conky Themes
A collection of my Conky configuration files.

- ### [Teal Red](https://github.com/chris-winta/Conky-Themes/tree/master/Teal_Red)
    A Conky theme strongly inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conkyporn/comments/9czm1n/finally_somewhat_happy_with_my_conky/) from [u/Trip-3R](https://www.reddit.com/user/Trip-3R). I have changed the colors and fonts, and slightly modified the overall layout.
