# Conky Themes
A collection of my Conky configuration files.

- ### [Teal Red](https://github.com/chris-winta/Conky-Themes/tree/master/Teal_Red)
    A Conky theme strongly inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conkyporn/comments/9czm1n/finally_somewhat_happy_with_my_conky/) from [u/Trip-3R](https://www.reddit.com/user/Trip-3R). I have changed the colors to match [elenapan](https://github.com/elenapan)'s [Lovelace color scheme](https://github.com/elenapan/dotfiles/blob/master/.xfiles/lovelace), fonts to the [Anka/Coder font family](https://code.google.com/archive/p/anka-coder-fonts/), and slightly modified the overall layout. Enjoy!
